<h1><span class="header-section-number">Section 6</span> Recycling</h1>
<p>We can leave small items outside our door for recycling pickup. For large items in future we should bring them to the A-level loading dock to be recycled.</p>
<div id="pi-office-hours" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> PI Office Hours</h2>
<p>In addition to weekly meetings (see below), and occasionally dropping by the lab, you can find Bridget in her office. Her door is almost always open; if it is, feel free to ask for a chat. If her door is closed, assume she is either gone, in a meeting in her office, or does not want to be disturbed – so please send a message (Slack or e-mail) rather than knocking.</p>
</div>
<div id="meetings" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Meetings</h2>
<div id="weekly-lab-meetings" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.1</span> Weekly Lab Meetings</h3>
<p>It is my expectation that all lab members are aware of what each other are working on. In knowing (and taking interest in what your lab mates are working on) it will make it feel like a lab community, rather than a bunch of people collaborating one-on-one with the PI. One of the forums where we can learn about each other’s work is in weekly lab meetings. These lab meetings will be approximately 1.5 hours and will involve a group project troubleshoot (~15-30 minutes), and a goal blitz for the week or month ahead (&lt;5 minutes per person). For the remaining 30-45 minutes of the lab meeting we will have different approaches depending on the amount of data and the stage of current projects. To begin with, while the Mind, Brain Body study is getting setup, one option (Thematic Learning option) is to have each of the core lab members taking turns to create a syllabus for a journal club that will occur over the next month (4 weeks). When the lab has some data to work on, we might begin to transition to a mix of Thematic Learning and Works in Progress. Works in Progress simply means that students take time to present their analyses or projects.</p>
<p>The group project troubleshoot will involve us working through problems that relate to the large group project (at this stage, the large group project is Growing Brains and Bodies project, funded through Bridget’s R00). As all lab members contribute to data collection for that project, we will talk about procedural issues like recruitment, planning the next wave of data collection etc. Troubleshooting for smaller individual projects will occur during one-and-one meetings with the PI (see below) and during the WIP session.</p>
<p>Goal blitz will involve every lab member going around and giving a very brief update of what they achieved during the week, and what their goals are for the coming week. This should be prepared ahead of time, and succinct! This will help everyone know what stage we are all at with our projects, and can also help with planning procedural issues – e.g., if many people are planning to be debugging code in the coming week, it might make sense to set up a code lunch so that you can help one another out.</p>
<p>Thematic Learning: The core lab member will identify an area of research that is relevant to the lab at the moment, or to their present work. For example, if we are discussing different memory assessments to add to the protocol for Growing Brains and Bodies, the lab member could make a syllabus on the theme of ‘measurement of memory across development’. They would then identify several papers in the area to put into a reading list (i.e., make a bibliography) and then assign some of the more pertinent papers to be discussed during Thematic Learning. Each student in the lab would then take turns leading the thematic learning component of the lab meeting on one of the assigned papers. Old syllabi will be available for new students to read, so that they can get up to date with the things we have been working on in the lab. This is a great way to get experience developing syllabi, teaching, and contributing to the knowledge base in the lab.</p>
<p>Works-in-Progress (WIP) will be assigned to one lab member each week during months where we are not doing Thematic Learning. This is an opportunity to present some data, or a task, or an idea that you are working on. Works-in-Progress are just that, in progress. This means that they should not be perfect presentations, but instead, should be a ‘warts and all’ look at what is going on with the data, analysis, code etc. The idea is to work as a group to constructively provide feedback and help one another move forward.</p>
<p>Occasionally, we may have joint lab meetings with other faculty in the department – these may be combined with our weekly lab meeting or an additional meeting. We will also use lab meetings (or ad-hoc scheduled meetings) to prepare for conference presentations and give people feedback on job talks or other external presentations. Lab meeting agendas and notes will be kept in the #lab-meetings channel on Slack.</p>
</div>
<div id="individual-meetings" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.2</span> Individual Meetings</h3>
<p>At the beginning of each term, we will set a schedule for weekly meetings. Each full-time lab member (RAs, graduate students, post-docs) will have a half-hour slot set aside to meet with Bridget. If scheduling conflicts arise (e.g., because of travel), we can try to reschedule for another day that week. If there is nothing to discuss, feel free to cancel the meeting or just drop by for a brief chat. If you need to speak for longer – please give advanced notice.</p>
<p>For full-time lab members, you should come to individual meetings prepared to talk about your career goals, your training goals, procedural aspects of your project, and your data. When we talk about your data, I suggest you bring along an R-Markdown file, or Keynote/PowerPoint that includes your raw data (e.g., histograms, scatter plots etc.) as well as any analyses that have been done, and figures produced from those analyses. This will help us to make the best use of our time and will save us digging around for data while we are meeting.</p>
<p>Post-docs, graduate students, and lab managers should meet with their undergraduate mentee/s on a regular basis.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="deadlines" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Deadlines</h2>
<p>One way of maintaining sanity in the academic work is to be as organized as possible. This is essential because disorganization doesn’t just hurt you, it hurts your collaborators and people whose help you need. When it comes to deadlines, tell your collaborators as soon as you know when a deadline is, make them a calendar reminder, and make sure you give them a friendly follow-up reminder about a week before the deadline.</p>
<p>For tasks with a hard deadline, but that don’t require a lot of time (e.g., reading/commenting on conference abstracts, filling out paperwork, etc.), please give Bridget at least a 7-day window. For tasks that require a moderate degree of work (e.g., a letter of recommendation), please give Bridget about a 3-week window (if possible). If you want feedback on research and teaching statements, or other work that requires multiple back-and-forth interactions between you and Bridget before a hard deadline, give her as much time as you can; a month or more.</p>
<p>For manuscript submissions and revisions (i.e., which either have no deadline at all or only a weak deadline), send drafts to Bridget as soon as you have them. She will get to them as soon as she gets a chance. Feel free to follow-up if you haven’t heard anything in a few weeks.</p>
</div>
<div id="presentations" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.4</span> Presentations</h2>
<p>Learning to present your research is important. Very few people will read your papers carefully (sad, but true) but you can reach a lot of people at conference talks and posters. Also, if you plan on staying in academia, getting a post-doc position and getting a faculty position both significantly depend on your ability to present your data. Even if you want to leave academia, presentations are likely to be an important part of your job. Additionally, every time you present your work, you are representing not just yourself but the entire lab.</p>
<p>It is therefore highly encouraged that you seek out opportunities to present your research, whether it is at departmental talk series and events, to other labs (within or outside of Columbia), at conferences, or to the general public. If you are going to give a presentation (a poster or a talk), be prepared to give a practice presentation to the lab at least one week ahead of time (two weeks or more are advisable for conference presentations, and many weeks ahead of time are advisable for job talks, which require much refining). Practice talks will help you feel comfortable with your presentation and will also allow you to get feedback from the lab and implement those changes well in advance of your real presentation.</p>
<p>Templates for posters will be available, and you can use those as much or as little as you’d like. Some general rules for posters should be followed: minimize text as much as possible (if you wrote a paragraph, you’re doing it wrong), make figures and text large and easy to see at a distance, label your axes, and make sure different colors are easily discriminable. Other than that, go with your own style.</p>
<p>Bridget is also happy to share slides from some of her talks if you would like to use a similar style. You’ll get a lot of feedback on your talks in any case, but other people’s slides might be helpful to you as you are setting up your talk. As with posters, feel free to go with your own style as long as it is polished and clear.</p>
</div>
<div id="recommendation-letters" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.5</span> Recommendation Letters</h2>
<p>Letters of recommendation are extremely important for getting new positions and grants. You can count on Bridget to write you a letter if you have been in the lab at least one year (it’s hard to really know someone if they have only been around for a few months). Exceptions can be made if students or post-docs are applying for fellowships shortly after starting in the lab.</p>
<p>If you need a letter, notify Bridget as soon as possible with the deadline (see Deadlines for guidance), your CV, and any relevant instructions for the content of the letter. If the letter is for a grant, also include your specific aims. If the letter is for a faculty position, also include your research and teaching statements. In some cases (especially if short notice is given), you may also be asked to submit a draft of a letter, which will be modified based on Bridget’s experience with you, made more glamorous (people are much too humble about themselves!), and edited to add anything you left out that Bridget thinks is important. This will ensure that the letter contains all the information you need, and that it is submitted on time.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-management" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.6</span> Data Management</h2>
<div id="storing-active-datasets" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.6.1</span> Storing Active Datasets</h3>
<p>Lab data can be stored in:</p>
<p>Although the servers are backed up, the backup is only on-site – so make extra backups! Each lab member should back up raw data on an external hard drive, as well as the code needed to reproduce all analyses. You should not store data locally on your computer (but logging into your server account on your computer is ok).</p>
</div>
<div id="data-organization" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.6.2</span> Data Organization</h3>
<p>If you have already run several independent projects and have a data organization structure that works well for you, feel free to use it. If not (or if you are looking for a change), the following structure is recommended (based on Neuropipe):</p>
<ul>
<li>projectName/subjects
<ul>
<li>individual directories for each of your participants</li>
<li>projectName/subjects/{subj}/analysis
<ul>
<li>subject-specific analyses (e.g., 1st and 2nd level analysis – at the run level and experiment level)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>projectName/subjects/{subj}/data
<ul>
<li>raw data for that participant, with the following directories…
<ul>
<li>behavioralData (for, well, behavioral data)</li>
<li>eyetrackingData (if applicable)</li>
<li>nifti (raw nifti files / raw MRI and fMRI data)</li>
<li>rois (participant-specific ROIs)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>projectName/subjects/{subj}/design
<ul>
<li>timing files for that participant, with different directories for the different GLMs you’re running (and the different runs in the experiment)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>projectName/subjects/{subj}/fsf
<ul>
<li>if you’re using FSL, put the .fsf fies here. If you’re using SPM or something else, save the files for setting up preprocessing and GLMs here</li>
</ul></li>
<li>projectName/subjects/{subj}/scripts
<ul>
<li>Matlab, Python, R, or bash scripts that you used for that participant. You should keep the ‘template’ scripts elsewhere, but you can store scripts you modified specifically for that participant here</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>projectName/scripts
<ul>
<li>template scripts and that you may modify for each participant, as well as scripts and functions used for all participants and group analyses</li>
<li>recommend making subdirectories for each type of analysis (e.g., behavior, pattern analysis, functional connectivity, univariate)</li>
<li>if you have scripts that are the same for each participant, you can have symbolic links for them in your participant-specific scripts directories</li>
</ul></li>
<li>projectName/results
<ul>
<li>figures with main results, powerpoint or keynote presentations, manuscripts if you wish</li>
</ul></li>
<li>projectName/notes
<ul>
<li>detailed notes about the design, analysis pipeline, relevant papers, etc</li>
</ul></li>
<li>projectName/group
<ul>
<li>group analyses</li>
<li>recommend making subdirectories for each type of analysis (e.g., behavior, pattern analysis, functional connectivity, univariate)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>projectName/task
<ul>
<li>code for your behavioral experiment, stimuli, piloting information</li>
<li>if you are running your presentation code off of the server, it will still be good to have a copy of the code here (but you can keep the stimuli only on the server if you’d like)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>When you leave the lab, your projects directories should be set up like this, or something similarly transparent, so that other people can look at your data and code. You must do this, otherwise your analysis pipeline and data structure will be uninterpretable to others once you leave, and this will slow everyone down (and cause us to bug you repeatedly to clean up your project directory or answer questions about it).</p>
</div>
<div id="archiving-inactive-datasets" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.6.3</span> Archiving Inactive Datasets</h3>
<p>Before you leave, or upon completion of a project, you must archive old datasets and back them up. We will develop the instructions for this when we reach our first inactive dataset.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="open-science" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.7</span> Open Science</h2>
<p>We’re all for open science, so lab members are required to share their code (and eventually the data) with others. Within lab, you can share your code and data whenever and in whatever way you like. But do not share your code or data with the outside world until you think (and Bridget agrees) that the lab has finished working with it. Currently, the best option for sharing smaller datasets might be the Open Science Framework, the best option for sharing MRI datasets is OpenFMRI, and the best option for sharing microbiome data is the Sequencing Read Archive or the European Nucleotide Archive.</p>
<p>We will also share our work with the world as soon as we ready, which means preprints! The lab policy is to upload a preprint of a manuscript simultaneously with initial submission to a journal. The preferred preprint servers are bioRxiv and PsyArXiv. We will also put PDF’s of all our papers on the lab website, and you should share PDF’s of your paper with whoever asks.</p>
